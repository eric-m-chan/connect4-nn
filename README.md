# Tackling Connect 4 with Reinforcement Learning
In this tutorial, we will demonstrate the basics of teaching a neural network to play connect 4 using Keras. The main tutorial can be found in `tutorial.pdf`


## Dependencies 
Python (3.6.9), Keras (2.4.3), and Tensorflow (2.3.1)
```
> pip install keras
> pip install tensorflow
```

## Basics
* `game.py` contains the connect4 game logic.
* `player.py` contains different player strategies. More strategies can be added
* `controller.py` helps us simulate games and extract results
* `model.py` builds up the neural network. Layer numbers/types/sizes can be adjusted.
* `main.py` defines which agents we are using to train/play against each other
